Building U-Boot
---------------

$ make mrproper

Choose one of the following:
$ make mx7dvar_som_defconfig			# For booting from SD card/eMMC
$ make mx7dvar_som_nand_defconfig		# For booting from NAND flash
$ make mx7dvar_som_SECURE_BOOT_defconfig	# For booting from SD card/eMMC with secure boot support
$ make mx7dvar_som_nand_SECURE_BOOT_defconfig	# For booting from NAND flash with secure boot support
$ make mx7dvar_som_android_defconfig		# For booting from SD card/eMMC (Android)

$ make


Flashing U-Boot to an SD card
-----------------------------

- After the 'make' command completes, flash the generated U-Boot
binary into the SD card:

$ sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=1; sync

(replace /dev/sdX with your correct device node)

- Insert the SD card into the slot

- Connect the debug cable to the host PC

- Make sure the boot select switches are on SD

- Power up the board and U-Boot messages will appear in the serial console.


For flashing U-Boot to NAND flash/eMMC and for a lot of more information,
